This project is related to 'Leveraging Remote Sensing and Deep Learning for Weed Detection: A Case Study in Multispectral Dataset Construction in Western Australia'.

## Summary

The Kondinin region in Western Australia faces significant agricultural challenges due to widespread weed infestations, resulting in considerable economic losses and ecological impacts.  To address these issues, this study focuses on constructing a customized multispectral remote sensing dataset to enhance precision agriculture practices.  Utilizing UAV technology, we collected raw multispectral data from the E2 and E8 experimental areas, covering 0.6046 km², from 2020 to 2023.  This data underwent extensive preprocessing, including denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and image stitching, to create a high-resolution, labeled multispectral image dataset tailored to the region's unique geographical conditions. We selected vegetation indices—NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, and MSAVI—as classification features and employed deep learning models to identify weeds, thereby validating the dataset's effectiveness in practical applications and it was used as a benchmark for weed detection in this area. This innovative dataset and methodology establish a robust foundation for future precision agriculture research in Western Australia and provide a valuable benchmark for advancing remote sensing applications in agriculture.


## Usage

The code files in this repository are used for preprocessing, filtering, calibration, and stitching of the original multispectral image dataset, as well as for feature selection and model training.
This project involves constructing a multispectral image dataset based on UAV data collected in the Kolinin region of Western Australia. The dataset has been made publicly available and can be accessed via the following link: Kolinin Multispectral Image Dataset. Due to the space limitations on GitHub, we have uploaded the dataset to a cloud storage platform.
